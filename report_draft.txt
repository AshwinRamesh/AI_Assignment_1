Aim
	The aim of Assignment 1 is to investigate the classification performance of a selection of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The study is to use a real-world data set with nine known attributes per sample. K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes classifiers are to be implemented and their performace compared to Machine Learning classifiers from the Weka Software package[1] using 10-fold stratified cross validation. The effects of feature selection - a pruning (or noise elimination technique), will also be explored.

Data set

			5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
			6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
			7. Diabetes pedigree function
