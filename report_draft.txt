Aim
	The aim of Assignment 1 is to investigate the classification performance of a selection of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The study is to use a real-world data set with nine known attributes per sample. K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes classifiers are to be implemented and their performace compared to Machine Learning classifiers from the Weka Software package[1] using 10-fold stratified cross validation. The effects of feature selection - a pruning (or noise elimination technique), will also be explored.

Data set
Write something here about the Data Set and attributes.
		Attributes
			1. Number of times pregnant
			2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
			3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
			4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
			5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
			6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
			7. Diabetes pedigree function
			8. Age (years)
			9. Class variable (0 or 1)
		
Implementation Language
	The implementation component of this Assignment was programmed in Python 2.7. 

Data preparation (preprocessing)
	To preprocess the data, the sample set was read from a file in CSV (comma seperated values) format. With the exception of Class variable, each attribute - column wise - was normalised using:
		(v_i - v_i_min)/(v_i_max - v_i_min)
	Where i is the attribute index. This results in each attribute taking a value within the range [0, 1]. The Class attribute for each sample is then changed from a binary 0 or 1 to "class0" or "class1". The data having been now normalised is then written back into a new CSV file named "pima.csv", and a file header for the attribute types inserted at the top, per Assignment requirements.
