Aim
	The aim of Assignment 1 is to investigate the classification performance of a number of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The study is to use a real-world data set with eight known attributes and class variable, per sample. K-Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayes classifiers are to be implemented and their performance compared to Machine Learning classifiers from the Weka Software package[1] using 10-fold stratified cross validation. The effects of feature selection - a pruning (or noise elimination technique), will also be explored.

Data set
	The data-set represents a subset of samples from a study originally done by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases based in the United States. It studied the diabetes rates of Americans with Pima Indian heritage living near Phoenix, Arizona. The subset of data donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository is focused on females over 21 years of age and contains sample attributes that may have correlation with diabetes incidence; such as the World Health Organizationâ€™s criteria for diabetes diagnosis: 2 hour post load plasma glucose levels. Wherein levels above 200mb/dl (11.1 mm/l) being indicative of the disease.[3]

	Attributes
		1. Number of times pregnant
		2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
		3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
		4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
		5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
		6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
		7. Diabetes pedigree function
		8. Age (years)
		9. Class variable (0 or 1)

The data-set is stored in text-readable CSV (comma separated values) format. Each row represents a sample, and each element of the row represents attributes 1 through to 8 in order, followed by a binary class variable {0,1}.
		
Implementation Language
	The preprocessing and implementation components of this Assignment were programmed in Python 2.7. 

Data preparation (preprocessing)
	To preprocess the data, the sample set was read from a file in CSV format. With the exception of Class variable, each attribute - column wise - was normalized using:
	v_normalized = (v_i - v_i_min)/(v_i_max - v_i_min)
	Where i is the attribute. This results in each attribute taking a value within the range [0, 1]. The Class attribute for each sample is then changed from a binary 0 or 1 to "class0" or "class1". The data having been now normalized is then written back into a new CSV file named "pima.csv", and a file header for the attribute types inserted at the top, per Assignment requirements.
